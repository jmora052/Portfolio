# Javier Morales - Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Javier! I am currently a Development Coordinator at a non-profit institution, transitioning into full-time Data Analytics. I have 3+ years of experience in Excel and 2+ years in SQL, and recently completed a SQL bootcamp to round out my skills and assist my transition.

Some of my work experience consists of various data projects at my current role, such as creating and managing our first Crowdfunding database, creating a SQL concatenation stored procedure to automate customer concatenation for mailing data, and automating various weekly reports through Excel macros and VLOOKUPS. My other experience includes 4+ years of managing concurrent projects with competing deadlines, growing a Crowdfunding program from the bottom to an almost $400,000 per year revenue core function, and presenting to Senior level colleagues with technical and non-technical backgrounds.

I will be storing my various Data Analytics portfolio projects here to showcase my SQL skills, share my projects, and track my growth.
